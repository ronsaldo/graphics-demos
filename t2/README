The Tarea 2 is written in C++, using SDL for window system interfacing, GLEW
for OpenGL extension access, and CMake for building.

Building requirements:
·A C++ compilers as g++.
·SDL development headers.
·GLEW development headers.
·CMake.
·A 32 bit or 64 bit x86 Linux system.

In Ubuntu the following shell command cane be used for installing the required
dependencies:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ libsdl1.2-dev libglew-dev cmake

For building, you have create a build folder an run CMake to generate the build
makefiles. For example, at the top source folder the following shell commands
can be used:

$ mkdir build-dir
$ cd build-dir
$ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"

That will generate the makefiles. Then for actually building you only have to
run make:
$ make

That last command is going to build the whole "Tarea2", producing a native
executable program in the dist folder under the created build directory.
To run the built program, at the dist folder the following shell command
can be used:

$ ./Tarea2
